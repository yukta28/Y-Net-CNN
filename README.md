The Y-Net CNN is a deep learning model that consists of two parallel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branches that merge into a fully connected classification layer. This architecture enhances feature extraction by processing input data through two separate branches with different dilation rates before combining the extracted features. We implement and optimize Y-Net for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification using Keras and TensorFlow. This paper discusses training methodologies, optimization techniques, and performance evaluation.
